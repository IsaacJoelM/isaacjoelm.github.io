        <h1>How to change a tire!</h1>

        <p>Step 1: Ensure you are on a level surface, with parking brake set. <br>
            Step 2: Get your spare tire, car jack, and tire iron (or ratchet fitting lug nuts) <br>
            Step 3: Locate your jack point on your vehicle. <br>
            *Note: If you cannot find a jack point, ensure jack is placed on the steel frame of the vehicle and not the plastic body* <br>
            Step 4: Before lifting your vehicle with the jack, loosen all lug nuts on the wheel. <br>
            Step 5: Engage your jack, either by pumping for hydraulic jacks or by twisting the nut on your jack <br>
            until the wheel is roughly 1 inch off the ground <br>
            Step 6: Remove lug nuts from wheel, and remove wheel from hub. <br>
            *Note: Placing the wheel you just removed under the frame by the jack will ensure if the jack fails your vehicle stays off the ground* <br>
            Step 7: Lift new wheel onto lugs -- for heavier wheels put the wheel on your legs and use them to help support while aligning wheel with lugs <br>
            Step 8: Hand tighten lug nuts onto wheel <br>
            Step 9: Using tire iron or a torque wrench, tighten lugs to torque or as tight as you can in a star pattern. <br>
            Step 10: Ensure wheel is firmly on the hub, and lower car back to the ground.
